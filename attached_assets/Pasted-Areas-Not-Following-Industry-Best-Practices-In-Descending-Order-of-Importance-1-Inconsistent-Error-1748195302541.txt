Areas Not Following Industry Best Practices (In Descending Order of Importance)
1 Inconsistent Error Handling
• Different error handling strategies across the application
• Missing standardized error logging and reporting
• Incomplete error recovery paths in critical components
2 Dual Storage Mechanisms
• Mixed localStorage direct access and abstracted StorageService
• Creates data inconsistencies and synchronization issues
• Complicates debugging and state management
3 Overlapping Event Systems
• Multiple event systems operating in parallel
• Missing centralized event management
• Inconsistent event naming and payload structures
4 Test Coverage Gaps
• Critical services with <25% test coverage
• Missing tests for error conditions and edge cases
• Insufficient integration tests for service interactions
5 Inconsistent Authentication Methods
• Multiple authentication implementations
• Redundant auth checks in different application layers
• Mixed API key and user authentication strategies
6 Legacy Code without Deprecation Strategy
• Many "will be removed in future" comments without concrete plan
• No deprecation warnings or migration guides
• Missing documentation for upgrading to newer patterns
7 Type Safety Inconsistencies
• Mixing of type assertions and runtime checks
• Usage of "any" types in critical paths
• Inconsistent type guard implementation
8 Component Re-rendering Inefficiencies
• Missing memoization for expensive operations
• Redundant state updates triggering re-renders
• Improper React.useCallback/useMemo implementation
9 Inconsistent Code Organization
• Mixed module patterns (singleton, factory, static)
• Circular dependencies in component imports
• Inconsistent folder and file structure
10 Environment Handling
• Direct NODE_ENV checks throughout codebase
• Missing feature flag system for environment-specific behavior
• Hardcoded environment assumptions
11 Configuration Management
• Scattered configuration values
• Missing centralized configuration validation
• Hardcoded default values without documentation
12 Documentation Gaps
• Inconsistent JSDoc usage
• Missing architecture decision records
• Insufficient documentation of complex interactions
