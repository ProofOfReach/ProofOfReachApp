# Nostr Ad Marketplace

## Project Overview

The Nostr Ad Marketplace is a decentralized platform that connects advertisers, publishers, and end-users using the Nostr protocol. This platform enables direct, transparent, and censorship-resistant advertising without relying on centralized intermediaries. By leveraging Nostr's decentralized communication infrastructure and Lightning Network for payments, this marketplace creates an open ecosystem for digital advertising that compensates all participants fairly, including the end-users who view ads and share their data.

What makes this platform unique is that end-users have complete control over their data and earn micropayments in bitcoin (via Lightning Network) for their attention and any data they choose to share. This creates a more equitable value exchange in the advertising ecosystem.

## Development Roadmap

Our development follows a strategic phased approach:

### Phase 1: Web-Based MVP (Current)
We're starting with a Next.js web application that implements core functionality:
- User authentication via Nostr with two methods:
  - NIP-07 browser extension login (Alby, nos2x, etc.)
  - Random key generation for testing ("Test Mode")
- SQLite + Prisma for reliable data persistence and relationships
- Basic marketplace for connecting advertisers and publishers
- Simple ad creation and listing capabilities
- Basic user data control panel and opt-in system
- Initial Lightning payment integration for all participants
- Minimal fraud protection (acknowledge potential for fraud in MVP phase)

### Phase 2: Browser Extension Companion & Basic Fraud Protection
Once the core concept is validated:
- Develop a companion browser extension
- Enable seamless ad display on publisher sites
- Provide verification and tracking mechanisms
- Enhance user experience for frequent platform users
- Add manual key entry (npub/nsec) as an additional authentication option
- Implement foundational fraud mitigation:
  - Delayed payouts (7-day holding period)
  - Minimum withdrawal thresholds
  - Session-based rate limiting
  - Basic behavioral metrics tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Platform & Comprehensive Fraud Protection
With market validation and user feedback:
- Migrate advanced functionality to the extension
- Enhance analytics and reporting capabilities
- Implement more sophisticated targeting options
- Optimize the payment experience
- Consider migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL or similar for scaling
- Deploy advanced fraud prevention mechanisms:
  - Machine learning-based anomaly detection
  - Social graph analysis for trust scoring
  - Advanced behavioral analysis
  - Publisher accountability mechanisms
  - Adaptive pricing based on traffic quality
