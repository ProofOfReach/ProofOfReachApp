You're absolutely right to prioritize proper architecture for a production app that needs to scale globally. Let me outline a detailed migration strategy to achieve the actual best practice architecture:

Migration Strategy to Best Practice Role-Based Architecture
1. Target Architecture
The ideal architecture for a scalable role-based application in Next.js follows these principles:

Single Source of Truth: All role data and permissions come from a secure, server-validated source
Clean URL Structure: Intuitive routing with proper access control
Component Reusability: Shared components across roles where possible
Performance Optimization: Minimize rerenders and state management overhead
Maintainability: Clear separation between role management and UI components
2. Migration Steps
Phase 1: Refactor Role Management (1-2 days)
Create a Unified Role Service:

Refactor roleService.ts to be the single source of truth
Implement proper database validation for all role claims
Add proper caching mechanisms for performance
Implement Server-Side Authentication Middleware:

Create a robust middleware system for role validation
Ensure all role-specific routes verify permissions server-side
Update Role Context Provider:

Streamline the context to focus solely on current role state
Remove any duplicate/redundant functionality
Phase 2: Reorganize Page Structure (2-3 days)
Define a Clear URL Strategy:

Map out all pages and their role requirements
Design URL paths that reflect logical content organization, not role types
Create Layout Components Hierarchy:

RootLayout: Base layout with authentication check
DashboardLayout: Core layout with navigation based on permissions
Role-specific layout components only when truly necessary
Implement Page-Level Role Control:

Create Higher-Order Components (HOCs) for role-specific access control
Ensure each page clearly defines what roles can access it
Phase 3: Migrate Content (3-4 days)
Create New Page Structure:

Establish new page files with proper role-based access controls
Start with shared/common pages that multiple roles can access
Migrate Page-Specific Components:

Move components from old structure to new one
Refactor as needed to work with the new role system
Implement Proper State Management:

Review all state implementations for role-specific data
Ensure state properly updates when roles change
Phase 4: Implement Redirects and Testing (2-3 days)
Create Temporary Redirects:

Add redirects from old URLs to new structure
Ensure bookmarks and deep links still work
Comprehensive Testing:

Test role transitions
Test permissions boundaries
Test all redirects
Test edge cases like direct URL access
Performance Testing:

Validate rendering performance across role transitions
Ensure no unnecessary rerenders occur
Phase 5: Cleanup and Documentation (1-2 days)
Remove Old Structure:

After confirming all functionality works, remove deprecated files
Clean up any legacy references
Document Architecture:

Create clear documentation of role management system
Document page access requirements
Create architecture diagrams
3. Technical Implementation Details
New Directory Structure

  /pages
    /api
      /auth
      /roles
      /[other API routes]
    /dashboard

    /auth
    /[other public pages]
  /components
    /layouts

  /hooks
    useAuth.ts
    useRoleAccess.ts (new hook for role verification)
  /context
    AuthContext.tsx (authentication)
    RoleContext.tsx (role management)
  /lib
    roleService.ts (robust role management)
    accessControl.ts (permissions management)
  /utils
Role-Based Access Control Implementation
// Example of the HOC we'd use to wrap pages
export function withRoleAccess(
  Component: React.ComponentType,
  allowedRoles: UserRole[]
) {
  return function WithRoleAccessComponent(props: any) {
    const { currentRole, isLoading } = useRoleContext();
    const router = useRouter();
    // Handle loading state
    if (isLoading) {
      return <LoadingScreen />;
    }
    // Redirect if user doesn't have permission
    if (!allowedRoles.includes(currentRole)) {
      router.push('/dashboard');
      return null;
    }
    // User has correct role, render the page
    return <Component {...props} />;
  };
}
// Usage on a page:
const AdvertiserCampaignsPage = () => {
  // Page content
};
export default withRoleAccess(AdvertiserCampaignsPage, ['ADVERTISER', 'ADMIN']);
4. Considerations and Potential Challenges
User Experience During Transition:

Consider how to maintain a smooth UX during transition
Implement appropriate loading states
Data Migration:

Ensure user preferences and settings migrate properly
Handle any role-specific stored data
Authentication Integration:

Ensure the role system integrates properly with Nostr authentication
SEO and Link Preservation:

Maintain proper redirects for any indexed pages
Update any external documentation
Testing Strategy:

Develop comprehensive test cases for all role transitions
Test boundary conditions extensively
