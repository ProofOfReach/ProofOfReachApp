## 2025-05-21 (Part 2) — Onboarding Step Numbering and UI Refinements

**Session Goal:** Improve the step numbering for Nostr extension users and enhance UI consistency across the platform.

**Problem Identified:**
- Step numbering for Nostr extension users was incorrect, showing "Step 4 of 6" instead of "Step 1 of 2"
- The OnboardingProgress component was not detecting Nostr extension users properly
- The role selection screen had a duplicate Proof Of Reach logo causing visual clutter
- Dashboard sidebar was using text "Nostr Ad Marketplace" instead of the consistent logo

**What Was Done:**
- Updated the OnboardingProgress component to properly detect Nostr extension availability
- Fixed step numbering logic to show "Step 1 of 2" and "Step 2 of 2" for Nostr extension users
- Removed the duplicate logo from the role selection screen for cleaner UI
- Replaced the text "Nostr Ad Marketplace" with the actual Proof Of Reach logo in the dashboard sidebar
- Ensured consistent branding across the platform with the same logo in navigation and sidebar

**Lessons Learned:**

## 2025-05-21 (Part 1) — Enhanced Onboarding Flow for Existing Nostr Users

**Session Goal:** Improve the onboarding experience for users who already have a Nostr account by skipping unnecessary steps.

**Problem Identified:**
- New users who already have a Nostr extension (existing Nostr users) were being shown the "Discover Personalized Content" step, which is redundant since they already participate in the Nostr ecosystem
- The initial viewing experience for Nostr users included unnecessary profile recommendations, creating friction in the onboarding process
- Real Nostr profile images were being displayed but were mismatched with account names due to improper pubkey format handling

**What Was Done:**
- Updated the `mapOnboardingStepToLocal` function in ViewerOnboarding to detect Nostr extension availability
- Added conditional logic to skip the discovery step for users with a Nostr extension, taking them directly to privacy settings
- Fixed the API endpoint for Nostr profile resolution to properly handle both npub and hex format pubkeys
- Updated the publisher data in ViewerOnboarding with correct Nostr hex pubkeys properly matched to names
- Improved error handling for invalid Nostr pubkeys in the profile API endpoint

**Lessons Learned:**
- Contextual onboarding flows provide better UX by respecting users' existing platform knowledge
- Detecting browser extensions (like Nostr) can help tailor the experience to different user types
- Real profile images enhance authenticity but require proper API integration with external protocols
- Pubkey format handling is crucial for correct identity display in decentralized applications
- Step skipping in onboarding flows should be intentional and based on user context

**Open Questions / Next Steps:**

## 2025-05-15 — User Role Management System Modernization

**Session Goal:** Update the role management system to use the new UserRole model structure instead of deprecated boolean flags.

**Problem Identified:**
- The system was using boolean flags (isAdmin, isPublisher, etc.) on the User model which have been deprecated
- API endpoints were failing with "Unknown argument" errors when trying to use these removed fields
- Role management functionality was broken with the updated database schema
- Test mode functionality needed proper integration with the new role system
- Need for clear distinction between role permissions and test mode functionality

**What Was Done:**
- Fixed login.ts to properly create and manage roles using the new UserRole table
- Updated all role-related endpoints (enable-roles.ts, test-mode, etc.) to use the proper role management system
- Fixed spaces/index.ts to properly set publisher role when creating ad spaces
- Completely rewrote users/set-role.ts with sophisticated role management functionality:
  - Proper role enabling/disabling in the UserRole table
  - Intelligent current role management with fallback roles
  - Comprehensive role transition handling
- Eliminated references to deprecated boolean flags (isAdmin, isPublisher, etc.) across the codebase
- Clarified the distinction between role enabling (database permissions) and test mode (UI activation)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Database schema evolution requires coordinated updates across the entire codebase
- Role management should be encapsulated in dedicated services for better maintainability
- It's important to maintain a clear distinction between permission management and UI element visibility
- Test mode serves as a safety mechanism for preventing accidental exposure of admin features in production

## 2025-05-14 (Part 2) — TestMode Banner Visibility and Role-Based Access Control

**Session Goal:** Fix issues with TestMode banner visibility to properly restrict debug features to admin users only.

**Problem Identified:**
- Security issue: The TestModeBanner and DebugRoleEnabler components were visible to all users, not just administrators
- React Hook rules violation: useTestMode hook was being called conditionally, violating React's rules of hooks
- Property name mismatch: The DebugRoleEnabler component was using the wrong property name (`isTestMode` instead of `isActive`)
- Event handler issues: Click events weren't properly wrapped in functions, leading to type errors

**What Was Done:**
- Updated DebugRoleEnabler component to use `isActive` instead of `isTestMode` to match the hook's interface
- Fixed React Hook usage rule violation by moving the hook call to the top level of the component
- Implemented triple-layer role verification for stronger access control:
  - Component state check
  - RoleManager service check (source of truth) 
  - useTestMode hook data check
- Added proper event handler wrapping for onClick events
- Enhanced logging for easier debugging of role/visibility issues
- Added defensive programming with comprehensive error handling

**Lessons Learned:**
- React Hooks must follow strict rules: Always call hooks at the top level, never conditionally
- Multiple verification layers: Implementing several checks creates a more robust security model
- Property naming consistency: Component properties should exactly match the interface they're working with
- Event handler wrapping: React event handlers need proper function wrapping to satisfy TypeScript type checking
- Defensive programming: Try/catch blocks with appropriate fallbacks make components more resilient
- Single source of truth: Using RoleManager as the authoritative source for role information ensures consistency

**Open Questions / Next Steps:**
1. Consider adding unit tests specifically for the visibility logic in DebugRoleEnabler
2. Evaluate consolidating role checking logic into a dedicated hook or utility function
3. Add analytics or monitoring for unauthorized access attempts to further strengthen security

## 2025-05-14 (Part 1) — TestMode Modernization and Test Coverage Improvements

**Session Goal:** Complete Phase 7 of TestMode modernization by fixing test failures, improving mock implementations, and enhancing test coverage for the TestModeService.

**Problem Identified:**
- Test failures: The testModeService.test.ts file was failing due to incomplete mock implementations, particularly for the logger.
- Missing mock methods: The logger mock did not include the `log` method used by the `setDebugMode` function.
- Inconsistent environment detection: Development environment checks needed proper TypeScript declarations for the `__DEV__` global variable.
- Circular dependencies: Some components had dependencies that created circular references, making testing difficult.
- Test isolation: Poor test isolation made it hard to pinpoint issues in specific TestMode functionality.

**What Was Done:**
- Fixed TestModeService tests by implementing a proper logger mock with the missing `log` method
- Created a focused test file (setDebugMode.test.ts) to isolate and verify the setDebugMode functionality
- Updated the main testModeService.test.ts file with simplified assertions for debug mode tests
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to the `__DEV__` global variable with proper type assertions
- Verified the TestModeBanner component tests are passing with the improved TestModeService
- Confirmed useTestMode hook tests function correctly with the updated implementation
- Improved test coverage by addressing edge cases in the TestModeService

**Lessons Learned:**
- Mock implementations matter: It's essential to provide complete mock implementations that match the exact function signatures used in the production code.
- Test isolation helps debugging: Creating focused test files for specific functionality makes it easier to identify and fix issues.
- Type declarations for globals: When using global variables like `__DEV__`, proper TypeScript declarations are needed to prevent type errors.
- Consistent event handling: Event-based systems need careful testing to ensure events are properly triggered and handled.
- Logger abstraction: Using a centralized logger that can be easily mocked is important for testing components that produce logs.
- Test coverage boundaries: Improving test coverage revealed edge cases in the implementation that weren't previously considered.
- Singleton lifecycle management: Proper initialization and resetting of singleton services between tests is crucial for test reliability.

**Session Goal:** Fix issues with Bitcoin icon not being properly displayed in the navigation menu, reduce console log spam from test mode, and implement a seamless role switching experience in test mode.

**Problem Identified:**
- Layout component imports: Multiple implementations of dashboard layouts with direct icon imports were not consistently using the same icon components.
- Menu item definitions: In ImprovedDashboardLayout.tsx, wallet and billing menu items were using DollarSign from react-feather instead of the custom BitcoinIcon component.
- Test mode logging: Excessive console logs from test mode were making debugging difficult and potentially affecting performance.
- Role switching in test mode: The role switching options were not easily accessible in the dashboard view, requiring users to navigate to a separate page.
- Multiple dashboard layout components: The project had redundant layout components (ImprovedDashboardLayout and NewDashboardLayout) causing confusion.
- Page reloads during role changes: Switching roles required a full page reload, causing a jarring experience with white flash and loss of UI state.

**What Was Done:**
- Updated ImprovedDashboardLayout.tsx to import and use the custom BitcoinIcon component
- Created a utility to disable test mode completely when needed for cleaner debugging
- Replaced React Feather DollarSign with BitcoinIcon for wallet and billing menu items

- Implemented seamless role switching without page reloads:
  - Added custom event system for coordinating role changes across components
  - Enhanced dashboard component to listen for multiple event types
  - Implemented local state updates instead of relying on page refreshes
  - Added fallback mechanisms through localStorage event listeners

**Lessons Learned:**
- Navigation components need consistent icon usage: When custom icons are created, ensure all layout components use them consistently.
- Multiple layout implementations: The project had several dashboard layout implementations (Sidebar.tsx, ImprovedDashboardLayout.tsx, StaticClientSidebar.tsx), and changes to icons need to be made in all relevant files.
- Test component vs production component: The layout rendered during tests may differ from the one used in production, requiring updates in multiple places.
- Icon imports matter: Direct imports from icon libraries (like react-feather) versus custom icon components can lead to inconsistency in the UI.
- Test mode UX: Test mode functionality should be visible and easily accessible throughout the application to improve developer experience.
- Component organization: Redundant layout components create maintenance burden and confusion about which component is actually being used.
- Event-based state management: Using custom events allows for seamless updates across components without page refreshes.
- Multiple event listeners: For critical UI changes like role switching, implementing multiple event listeners (direct, custom events, storage) provides resilience and flexibility.
- Progressive enhancement: Starting with a functional implementation that uses page reloads, then enhancing with in-place updates is a good approach to balancing reliability with user experience.
