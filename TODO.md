# Project TODO

## Critical Issues Not Following Industry Best Practices (Descending Priority)

### [CRITICAL - Production Blocking]
1. **Missing Page Components Preventing Build**
   - [ ] Create missing dashboard pages: `/dashboard/ad-spaces/create`, `/dashboard/admin/*`, `/dashboard/ads/*`
   - [ ] Create missing `/contact` page referenced in navigation
   - Production builds fail completely due to missing page modules

2. **TypeScript Type Safety Crisis**  
   - [ ] Fix 2000+ TypeScript errors across codebase
   - [ ] Replace all `any` types with proper type definitions
   - [ ] Fix inconsistent error parameter typing (unknown vs Record<string, any>)
   - [ ] Implement proper type guards and runtime validation

3. **Inconsistent Error Handling Architecture**
   - [ ] Standardize error logging across all services (currently mixing patterns)
   - [ ] Fix logger.log() calls with incompatible parameter types
   - [ ] Implement centralized error recovery and reporting system
   - [ ] Remove hardcoded error() function calls that break API routes

### [HIGH - Development Stability]
4. **Test Infrastructure Breakdown**
   - [ ] Fix 62 failed test suites (55% failure rate)
   - [ ] Resolve component import errors causing "Element type is invalid" 
   - [ ] Fix missing QueryClient providers in test utilities
   - [ ] Address Babel transformation errors breaking test compilation

5. **Authentication System Fragmentation**
   - [ ] Consolidate multiple competing auth providers (3+ different implementations)
   - [ ] Fix useAuthRefactored hook being called outside provider context
   - [ ] Eliminate redundant auth middleware implementations
   - [ ] Standardize session management between localStorage and Supabase

6. **Component Definition Inconsistencies**
   - [ ] Fix undefined component exports causing runtime crashes
   - [ ] Resolve circular import dependencies in layout components
   - [ ] Standardize default vs named export patterns
   - [ ] Fix missing component type definitions

### [MEDIUM - Code Quality]
7. **Configuration and Environment Management**
   - [ ] Centralize scattered configuration values
   - [ ] Replace direct NODE_ENV checks with environment service
   - [ ] Implement proper feature flag system
   - [ ] Validate environment variables at startup

8. **State Management Complexity**
   - [ ] Consolidate dual storage mechanisms (localStorage + StorageService)
   - [ ] Eliminate overlapping event systems creating conflicts
   - [ ] Implement centralized state management strategy
   - [ ] Fix component re-rendering inefficiencies

### [LOW - Technical Debt]
9. **Legacy Code Without Migration Strategy**
   - [ ] Create concrete deprecation timeline for "will be removed" components
   - [ ] Document migration paths for legacy patterns
   - [ ] Implement deprecation warnings in development
   - [ ] Establish code review standards for new implementations

10. **Documentation and Architecture**
    - [ ] Document current authentication flow and role management
    - [ ] Create architecture decision records for major system components
    - [ ] Standardize JSDoc usage across services
    - [ ] Document complex service interactions and dependencies
