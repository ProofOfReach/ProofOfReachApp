# Technical Debt Tracker

This document tracks technical debt items that need to be addressed in the Nostr Ad Marketplace project.

## High Priority

1. **ErrorBoundary Component Integration**
   - Issue: ErrorBoundary component fails to work with the new error service
   - Error: `TypeError: _errorService.errorService.reportError is not a function`
   - Impact: Component tests are failing and runtime errors may not be properly captured
   - Resolution: Update ErrorBoundary to use the correct method from the new error service

2. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - Issue: Multiple test failures across the codebase (190+ failed tests)
   - Impact: Reduces confidence in code changes and may hide regressions
   - Resolution: Systematically fix failing tests, starting with most critical components

3. **Deprecated Warnings in Test Mode**
   - Issue: Console warnings about deprecated testModeEvents.ts
   - Warning: `DEPRECATED: Using old testModeEvents.ts is deprecated. Use the new event system from @/lib/events instead`
   - Impact: Creates console noise and indicates reliance on legacy code
   - Resolution: Migrate all testModeEvents usage to the new event system

## Medium Priority

1. **Role Terminology Standardization**
   - Issue: Inconsistent role terminology across components
   - Impact: Confusing developer and user experience with mixed terminology
   - Resolution: Continue standardizing "viewer" vs "user" terminology using the strangler fig pattern

2. **Authentication Refactoring Warnings**
   - Issue: Debug messages about useAuthRefactored being called outside provider
   - Warning: `useAuthRefactored called outside of AuthProviderRefactored`
   - Impact: Indicates incomplete migration to new authentication system
   - Resolution: Complete migration to new authentication system or fix provider wrapping

3. **Build Process Optimization**
   - Issue: Slow compilation times (60+ seconds)
   - Impact: Developer productivity is reduced by long build cycles
   - Resolution: Optimize webpack configuration, implement code splitting

## Low Priority

1. **Next.js Configuration Warning**
   - Issue: Cross-origin request warnings in development
   - Warning: `Cross origin request detected from ... to /_next/* resource`
   - Impact: Console noise only; doesn't affect functionality
   - Resolution: Configure "allowedDevOrigins" in next.config.js

2. **.gitignore Maintenance**
   - Issue: Binary cache files and coverage reports being tracked
   - Impact: Bloats repository size and creates unnecessary conflicts
   - Resolution: Ensure .gitignore is comprehensive for all build artifacts

3. **Legacy Branch Cleanup**
   - Issue: Multiple feature branches that could be consolidated
   - Impact: Repository management complexity
   - Resolution: Clean up unnecessary branches once features are fully integrated

## Technical Improvement Opportunities

1. **Error Handling Expansion**
   - Opportunity: Apply improved error handling pattern to more components
   - Benefit: More resilient application with better user feedback

2. **Test Mocking Standardization**
   - Opportunity: Create standardized mock patterns for common dependencies
   - Benefit: More consistent and maintainable tests

3. **Modernize Event System**
   - Opportunity: Complete migration to new event system
   - Benefit: Simpler, more consistent event handling across the application

## Future Onboarding Upgrades

1. **Authentication Enhancements**
   - Multi-device login support with device management
   - Progressive authentication with two-factor options
   - Enhanced accessibility following WCAG standards

2. **Onboarding Experience Refinements**
   - Smart defaults and personalized recommendations
   - Continuous onboarding with feature discovery
   - Seamless transitions between different user roles

3. **Backend Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Performance optimization via strategic caching
   - Comprehensive analytics for onboarding funnel tracking
   - Security hardening with rate limiting and audit logs
