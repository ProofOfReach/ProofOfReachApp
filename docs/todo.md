# TODO: Remaining High-Level Work

## CRITICAL: Production Build Blockers (Immediate Priority)

### **DEVELOPMENT SERVER FUNCTIONAL** ⭐ **CURRENT STATUS**
- [x] **Development server running successfully** (Start Dev Server active)
- [x] **Fixed all 37+ DashboardLayout reference errors** (comprehensive layout fix script)
- [x] **Created missing essential pages** (how-it-works, publisher, terms, test-auth, system/logout)
- [x] **Resolved import and component reference issues**
- [x] **Application compiling and loading properly in development**
- [ ] **Production builds still failing** (strict validation catches issues dev tolerates)
- [ ] **Missing pages for production**: /dashboard/ads, /auth-direct, /dashboard/advertiser
- [ ] **Strategy**: Development server is stable for testing, production builds need additional page implementations

### 1. **Critical Test Infrastructure Failures** ⚠️ **BLOCKING TESTS ONLY**
- [ ] **2,383 TypeScript errors** in test files (28 failed, 16 passed test suites)
- [ ] **Primary Issue**: `UserRole` identifier conflicts in testModeStorageService.ts
- [ ] **Secondary Issue**: Missing module imports (`../defaultUseRoleAccess`, `../../../lib/roles/roleUtils`)
- [ ] **Babel Parser Errors**: Import/export declaration conflicts throughout test files
- [ ] **Mock Setup Problems**: ErrorProvider, logger.log, console.log mocking failures

## Notes

### Current Status
- Landing page loads successfully
- Application compiles but has runtime errors
- Basic navigation works but with console errors
- Currency functionality partially working
- Role management system needs complete overhaul

### Priority Order
1. Fix critical runtime errors to get basic functionality working
2. Restore component architecture and proper UI rendering
3. Improve type safety and code quality
4. Implement remaining features and polish
5. Prepare for production deployment

### Technical Debt
- Multiple temporary fixes and div replacements need proper implementation
- Fragmented role management system needs consolidation
- Error handling system needs complete restructuring
- Import/export system needs cleanup and organization

## Additional Items from LEARNINGS.md and Conversation

### Future Architecture Ideas
- [ ] Implement more formal role-based access control (RBAC) system
- [ ] Consider consolidating role checking logic into a dedicated hook or utility function
- [ ] Add analytics or monitoring for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Evaluate implementing more streamlined test mode experience with clearer UI
- [ ] Consider adding more robust error handling for roles that aren't properly initialized

### Technical Debt from Previous Sessions
- [ ] Update role management UI to better reflect distinction between role permissions and test mode
- [ ] Document the role management system architecture for future developers
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for role transition edge cases
- [ ] Consider adding unit tests specifically for visibility logic in DebugRoleEnabler
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling with appropriate fallbacks for component resilience

### Security and Access Control
- [ ] Implement triple-layer role verification for stronger access control (component state, RoleManager service, useTestMode hook)
- [ ] Add proper event handler wrapping for onClick events to satisfy TypeScript
- [ ] Enhance logging for easier debugging of role/visibility issues
- [ ] Maintain clear distinction between permission management and UI element visibility

### Database and State Management
- [ ] Coordinate database schema evolution with codebase updates
- [ ] Encapsulate role management in dedicated services for better maintainability
- [ ] Store user roles as records in separate table for flexibility and future expansion
- [ ] Provide fallback options when current role is disabled during transitions

### Development Best Practices
- [ ] Follow React Hooks rules strictly (always call hooks at top level, never conditionally)
- [ ] Implement single source of truth using RoleManager for role information consistency
- [ ] Use defensive programming with try/catch blocks and appropriate fallbacks
- [ ] Maintain property naming consistency between components and interfaces

## UX Improvements (Critical)

### 8. Progressive Disclosure & Guided Workflows
- [ ] **Issue**: All campaign options shown at once, overwhelming users
- [ ] **Solution**: Step-by-step wizard with clear progress indicators
- [ ] **Implementation**: "Campaign Details" → "Ad Creative" → "Review" → "Launch/Fund"

### 9. Clear Status Management & State Transparency
- [ ] **Issue**: Users don't understand campaign states
- [ ] **Solution**: Clear status badges and next actions
- [ ] **Implementation**: "Draft" → "Pending Funding" → "Under Review" → "Active" → "Paused"

### 10. Contextual Help & Empty States
- [ ] **Issue**: No guidance when users are stuck
- [ ] **Solution**: Inline help, tooltips, and empty state illustrations
- [ ] **Implementation**: "No campaigns yet? Create your first campaign" with helpful tips

### 11. Error Prevention vs Error Handling
- [ ] **Issue**: Users can create invalid campaigns
- [ ] **Solution**: Validate inputs in real-time, prevent errors before they happen
- [ ] **Implementation**: Live budget validation, sufficient balance warnings

### 12. Consistent Feedback & Loading States
- [ ] **Issue**: Actions happen without clear feedback
- [ ] **Solution**: Loading spinners, success messages, progress indicators
- [ ] **Implementation**: "Creating campaign..." → "Campaign created successfully!"

### 13. Mobile-First Responsive Design
- [ ] **Issue**: Desktop-focused layout
- [ ] **Solution**: Touch-friendly, mobile-optimized interfaces
- [ ] **Implementation**: Responsive breakpoints, touch targets, swipe gestures

### 14. Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] **Issue**: Mouse-dependent interactions
- [ ] **Solution**: Screen reader support, keyboard shortcuts, focus management
- [ ] **Implementation**: ARIA labels, tabindex, keyboard event handlers

### 15. Funding Workflow Separation ⭐ **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] **Issue**: Funding mixed into campaign creation process
- [ ] **Solution**: Separate funding from campaign creation
- [ ] **Implementation**: Create campaign → Status shows "Pending Funding" → Dedicated funding flow
