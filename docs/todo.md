- [ ] Fix error integration test failures
- [ ] Implement consistent error reporting across the application

### 6. Role Management System
- [ ] Create unified role service to replace fragmented role management

- [ ] Implement proper role permissions and access control
- [ ] Fix role transition functionality and state management

## Type Safety and Code Quality (Medium Priority)

### 7. TypeScript Issues Resolution
- [ ] Fix UserRole type definition conflicts
- [ ] Resolve "string only refers to a type" errors throughout codebase
- [ ] Fix type mismatches in role-related functions
- [ ] Ensure proper typing for all React components and hooks

### 8. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Fix broken test files and mock implementations
- [ ] Update test utilities to work with current component structure
- [ ] Fix failing test suites for role management and error handling
- [ ] Implement proper test coverage for critical functionality

## Feature Implementation (Lower Priority)

### 9. Currency System Enhancement
- [ ] Improve currency context reliability and error handling
- [ ] Fix BTC price fetching and conversion accuracy
- [ ] Implement proper fallback mechanisms for currency display
- [ ] Add currency preference persistence across sessions

### 10. Navigation and Routing
- [ ] Fix middleware domain-based access control
- [ ] Implement proper route guards based on user roles
- [ ] Fix navigation between different sections of the app
- [ ] Ensure proper redirect handling for unauthorized access

### 11. UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Restore proper icon usage throughout the application
- [ ] Fix layout inconsistencies in dashboard and other pages
- [ ] Implement proper loading states and skeleton screens
- [ ] Improve responsive design and mobile compatibility

## Infrastructure and Deployment (Future)

### 12. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize bundle size and reduce compilation warnings
- [ ] Implement proper code splitting for role-specific features
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Optimize database queries and API calls

### 13. Security Hardening
- [ ] Implement proper API key validation and rotation
- [ ] Add rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Secure sensitive operations with proper authorization
- [ ] Add audit logging for administrative actions

### 14. Production Readiness
- [ ] Fix all TypeScript compilation errors for production builds
- [ ] Implement proper environment configuration management
- [ ] Add comprehensive error monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Set up proper CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

## Notes

### Current Status
- Landing page loads successfully
- Application compiles but has runtime errors
- Basic navigation works but with console errors
- Currency functionality partially working
- Role management system needs complete overhaul

### Priority Order
1. Fix critical runtime errors to get basic functionality working
2. Restore component architecture and proper UI rendering
3. Improve type safety and code quality
4. Implement remaining features and polish
5. Prepare for production deployment

### Technical Debt
- Multiple temporary fixes and div replacements need proper implementation
- Fragmented role management system needs consolidation
- Error handling system needs complete restructuring
- Import/export system needs cleanup and organization

## Additional Items from LEARNINGS.md and Conversation

### Future Architecture Ideas
- [ ] Implement more formal role-based access control (RBAC) system
- [ ] Consider consolidating role checking logic into a dedicated hook or utility function
- [ ] Add analytics or monitoring for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Evaluate implementing more streamlined test mode experience with clearer UI
- [ ] Consider adding more robust error handling for roles that aren't properly initialized

### Technical Debt from Previous Sessions
- [ ] Update role management UI to better reflect distinction between role permissions and test mode
- [ ] Document the role management system architecture for future developers
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for role transition edge cases
- [ ] Consider adding unit tests specifically for visibility logic in DebugRoleEnabler
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling with appropriate fallbacks for component resilience

### Security and Access Control
- [ ] Implement triple-layer role verification for stronger access control (component state, RoleManager service, useTestMode hook)
- [ ] Add proper event handler wrapping for onClick events to satisfy TypeScript
- [ ] Enhance logging for easier debugging of role/visibility issues
- [ ] Maintain clear distinction between permission management and UI element visibility

### Database and State Management
- [ ] Coordinate database schema evolution with codebase updates
- [ ] Encapsulate role management in dedicated services for better maintainability
- [ ] Store user roles as records in separate table for flexibility and future expansion
- [ ] Provide fallback options when current role is disabled during transitions

### Development Best Practices
- [ ] Follow React Hooks rules strictly (always call hooks at top level, never conditionally)
- [ ] Implement single source of truth using RoleManager for role information consistency
- [ ] Use defensive programming with try/catch blocks and appropriate fallbacks
- [ ] Maintain property naming consistency between components and interfaces
